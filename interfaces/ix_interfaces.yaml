          - Administrative state of the interface.
          - Set the value to C(true) to administratively enable the interface or C(false)
            to disable it.

      description:
        - The state the configuration should be left in
        - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
          on the device.
        - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
          platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
          within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
          not required.
        - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
          it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
          the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
          value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
          option should be the same format as the output of command
          I(show running-config | section ^interface) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
          connection to remote host is not required.
