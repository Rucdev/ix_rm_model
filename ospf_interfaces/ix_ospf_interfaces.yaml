      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the ix

      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config)
        option and transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the
        resource module's argspec and the value is then returned in the
        I(parsed) key within the result.

    description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
        on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
        platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
        within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
        not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
        the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
        value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
        option should be the same format as the output of command I(show running-config ospf)
        executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
